<h2>Piggy Bank</h2>

This is my project submission for the MITxPRO Front End Banking App submission.

<br></br>
<p>This mock banking app is a single page application in standalone format.  It utilizes the useContext method as well as props to share user input in the  "create account" page with the other components.  It includes a bootstrap navbar and shared card components.</p>

<h3>Roadmap To Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Convert to React App with all updated dependencies for greater ability to import bootstrap design implements such as tooltips.</li>
  <li>Add user login component so that specific user data may be accessed.</li>
  <li>Update "createaccount" file with coding to give every submission a unique index identifier.</li>
  <li>Update "alldata" file to include coding to pass user data into individual bootstrap cards.</li>
</ul>
